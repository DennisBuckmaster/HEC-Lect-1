Not drawing bow across violin
Yet he felt its cry
Not calculating fingers on keys
Yet he let the notes converse with him
Not pressing lips to golden trumpet
Yet the sound soared and expanded in him
Not beating hands on drum skins
Yet his mind moved in time
Not a playing member

Yet he knew how to listen
